# 🐛 BugFix: Discovered Devices Not Appearing in UI

## Problems Identified

### Problem #1: Incorrect `isNearby` Classification
**File**: `device_adapter.dart` line 76
**Issue**: Using `!internal.paired` to determine `isNearby` is incorrect

**Old Logic**:
```dart
isNearby: !internal.paired, // WRONG - confuses bonded vs discovered
```

**What was happening**:
- Bonded devices (paired=true) got `isNearby: false` ✓ CORRECT
- Discovered devices (paired=false) got `isNearby: true` ✓ CORRECT
- BUT: Bonded devices NOT yet connected also get paired=true, so they were correctly marked as NOT nearby

**Actual bug**: The `isSavedDevice` parameter wasn't being used to determine `isNearby`.

**New Logic**:
```dart
isNearby: (isSavedDevice == false), // true for discovered, false for bonded
```

### Problem #2: Fallback Device in discoveredDevicesStream Had Same Bug
**File**: `device_connection_manager.dart` line 485
**Issue**: When enrichment fails, fallback device was using `!btDevice.paired`

**Old**:
```dart
isNearby: !btDevice.paired, // Could be false for newly discovered devices
```

**New**:
```dart
isNearby: true, // Always true - discovered devices are always nearby
```

### Problem #3: Insufficient Visibility Into Device Emission
**Added Logging**:
- When bonded devices are emitted, now logs device list with properties
- When discovered devices are emitted, now logs device list with properties
- Each device shows: `isPaired`, `isNearby`, `services count`

## Changes Applied

### 1. device_adapter.dart (Line 76)
```dart
// OLD:
isNearby: !internal.paired,

// NEW:
isNearby: (isSavedDevice == false), // true for discovered, false for bonded
```

### 2. device_connection_manager.dart (Line 485)
```dart
// OLD:
isNearby: !btDevice.paired,

// NEW:
isNearby: true, // Always true for discovered devices
```

### 3. device_connection_manager.dart - Enhanced Logging
Added detailed logging when emitting devices:
- Bonded device list with properties (line 849-853)
- Discovered device list with properties (line 498-502)

## Expected Flow After Fix

```
Initialize
  ↓
_loadBondedDevices()
  ├─ Load bonded devices
  ├─ Enrich each with DeviceAdapter(isSavedDevice: true)
  │  → Gets isNearby: false ✓
  ├─ Add to _deviceStates
  └─ Emit with logging
     Logs: "isPaired=true, isNearby=false"

BLE Scan Starts
  ↓
discoveredDevicesStream processes each device
  ├─ DeviceAdapter(isSavedDevice: false)
  │  → Gets isNearby: true ✓
  ├─ Add to _deviceStates
  └─ Emit with logging
     Logs: "isPaired=false, isNearby=true"

DeviceManagerService Receives
  ↓
deviceStream() filters:
  ├─ bonded devices (isPaired=true, isNearby=false) → "My Devices" ✓
  ├─ discovered devices (isPaired=false, isNearby=true) → "Scanned Devices" ✓
  └─ All devices shown correctly
```

## Verification Checklist

Test on real device:

- [ ] App starts without errors
- [ ] Bonded devices appear in "My Devices"
- [ ] Each bonded device shows: `isPaired=true, isNearby=false`
- [ ] BLE scan finds discovered devices
- [ ] Each discovered device shows: `isPaired=false, isNearby=true`
- [ ] Discovered devices appear in "Scanned Devices"
- [ ] Services count shown (0 for unpaired, as expected)
- [ ] Logs clearly show isNearby values for each device

## Files Modified

1. `lib/src/internal/adapters/device_adapter.dart`
   - Line 76: Fixed isNearby logic to use `isSavedDevice` parameter

2. `lib/src/internal/bluetooth/device_connection_manager.dart`
   - Line 485: Fixed fallback device isNearby to always be `true`
   - Line 849-853: Added logging for bonded devices emission
   - Line 498-502: Added logging for discovered devices emission

## Status

✅ **Compilation**: No critical errors
✅ **Logic**: Fixed `isNearby` classification
✅ **Logging**: Enhanced to show device properties on emission

Ready to test on real device.
