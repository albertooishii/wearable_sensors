// üîç Enriched Device Scanner - Dream Incubator
// Orchestrates BLE discovery + parallel connection enrichment
//
// Workflow:
// 1. Discovery Phase: Passive BLE scanning for ~5-7s
// 2. Enrichment Phase: Connect to each device in parallel
//    - Discover GATT services
//    - Read battery level
//    - Detect device type
//    - Disconnect
// 3. Progressive emission: WearableDevice objects as they're enriched
